# Problem

- Create two new Components (manually or with CLI): WarningAlert and SuccessAlert
- Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent
- Output a warning or success message in the Components
- Style the Components appropriately (maybe some red/green text)
- Use external or internal templates and styles!
- Feel free to create more components, nest them into each other or play around with different types of selectors!
